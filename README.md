## Functionality Requirements

The component must have the following functionalities:

Initially, all the cards of the customer will be shown as a card component listed as Card1, Card2,...CardN. When the user clicks on a card, the detailed card should appear on the screen with details encrypted. When clicked on the detailed card, the details of the user's card should get decrypted and displayed, i.e Card Number, Expiry Date, CVV, Name on Card, etc. Also, to distinguish the cards, the first 4 digits of the card number and the bank name should be visible initially.
